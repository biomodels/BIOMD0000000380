# Model Notes


This model is from the article:  
**Building a Kinetic Model of Trehalose Biosynthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.**   
Smallbone K, Malys N, Messiha HL, Wishart JA, Simeonidis E. _Methods Enzymol._

**Abstract:**   
In this chapter, we describe the steps needed to create a kinetic model of a
metabolic pathway based on kinetic data from experimental measurements and
literature review. Our methodology is presented by utilizing the example of
trehalose metabolism in yeast. The biology of the trehalose cycle is briefly
reviewed and discussed.
